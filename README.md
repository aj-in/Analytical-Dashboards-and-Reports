 <h3> 1) Airbnb Analysis </h3>

To conduct a market analysis for investors, Airbnb's public datasets were used to derive the appropriate time and location which were likely to be useful for the investors to rent their properties.

The important use case of this dashboard is to provide investors with valuable insights into consumer behavior, demand fluctuations, and geographic preferences. This study aims to use publicly available Airbnb datasets to provide actionable intelligence for strategic property investment.
